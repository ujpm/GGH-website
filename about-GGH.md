Our Story
The Global Grants Hub was founded in 2023 by Richardson Kyeyune, a visionary leader with 
a deep passion for empowering communities and driving sustainable development. 
Richardson's journey began in 2002 with World Vision Uganda in Rakai District, during his 
extensive work with various non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society 
organizations (CSOs). Through these experiences, he witnessed firsthand the challenges these 
organizations faced in securing funding and accessing resources to implement their impactful 
projects.
Having become an orphan at the age of 9 months, Richardson personally understood the need 
on the ground to empower lives and create opportunities for those in need. His dedication to 
making a difference in the world was ignited during his involvement in grassroots initiatives, 
where he saw the transformative power of collaboration and innovation. He recognized that 
many organizations, despite their potential and commitment, struggled to navigate the 
complex landscape of grant applications and funding opportunities. This realization fueled his 
determination to create a platform that would bridge this gap and provide the necessary 
support to those in need.
In March 2023, Richardson launched the Global Grants Hub with a clear mission: to 
empower civil society organizations, NGOs, entrepreneurs, and students by facilitating 
valuable funding opportunities and resources. His vision was to create a dynamic community 
where like-minded individuals and organizations could come together, share knowledge, and 
collaborate to drive positive change.
Under Richardson's leadership, the Global Grants Hub has grown into a global network of 
passionate and dedicated members, all working towards a common goal of transforming 
communities and making a lasting impact. Through mentorship, training, and resource 
sharing, the Hub has become a beacon of support and inspiration for organizations and 
individuals striving to make a difference.
Richardson's unwavering commitment to social impact and sustainable development 
continues to guide the Global Grants Hub, ensuring that it remains a vital resource for those 
seeking to create positive change in the world. His story is a testament to the power of vision, 
perseverance, and the belief that by working together, we can achieve remarkable things.
